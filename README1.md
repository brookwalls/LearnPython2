# LearnPython2 

Exercise 1: A Good First Program
	- No compile fuction in python 
	- Type python2 filename.py to run the program in the command line
	- Use # instead of // to make a comment 

Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
	- Tips to find errors: reading the code backwards or out loud

Exercise 3: Numbers and Math
	- Comparison in python are more simple
	- Don't need a ; at the end of each line
	- For print line you don't have to have () just ""
	- still use %d %s

Exercise 4: Variables and Names
	- When declaring variables you don't state its type 

Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing
	- When setting variable to string enclose it in 'string'
	- When printing variables leave %s for string and %d for an int. 
	- After the ending " you put % and then the variable name
	- For multiple put them in () seperated by commas. 

Exercise 6: Strings and Text
	- Went through what you can do with strings variables.

Exercise 7: More Printing
	- Practice

Exercise 8: Printing, Printing
	- Practice 

Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing
	- Print """ prints out anything after for how every many lines untill """
	
Exercise 10: What Was That?
	- Escape sequences: formats print lines and prints special characters

Exercise 11: Asking Questions
	- raw_input allows the user to input values

Exercise 12: Prompting People
	- Ex: raw_input("Question? "), can be used to prompt a input

Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables
	- Went through how to import input values when runing the file

Exerise 14: Prompting and Passing
	- Went through ways of getting input and using what your given

Exerise 15: Reading Files
	- Went through two way you can read a file
	- open(filename), opens the file
	- filename_var.read(), reads the file
	- print filename_var.read(), prints out the file 
	
Exercise 16: Reading and Writing Files
	- Program: opens, reads and writes information into the file.
	- Mentions commands you can give files such as close, read, readline, truncate, write(stuff)

Exercise 17: More Files
	- Program used open, write, close, read to show how you can use file and what you can do with them.

Exercise 18: Names, Variables, Code, Functions
	- Went through the syntax for making functions
	- def function_name(args):

Exercise 19: Functions and Variables
	- Went through different ways of giving arguments to functions.
	  - Give numbers directly
	  - Variables from script
    - You can math, Ex: cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)
    - You can use variables and math

Exercise 20: Functions and Files
	- Program: printed out a file line by line

Exercise 21: Functions Can Return Something
	- Use keyword return when you want the function to return a value

Exercise 24: More Practice 
	- Practice 

Exercise 25: Even More Practice
	- In the command line: import ex25, define a variable and called on functions in ex25 

Exercise 26: Congratulations, Take a Test!
	- Fixed errors and made the program run

Exercise 27: Memorizing Logic
	- Studied truth terms and tables 

Exercise 28: Boolean Practice
	- Practice boolean tests to see if I got the correct answer

Exercise 29: What If
	- Syntax for if statements: if var1 operator var2:

Exercise 30: Else and If
	- Syntax for if-elif-else statements
	- if var1 operator var2:
	- elif var1 operator var2:
	- else var1 operator var2:
	- You can have as many elif statements as you want
	

Exercise 31: Making Decisions
	- Program had multiple if statments that lead to other if starments, I expanded the program

Exercise 32: Loops and Lists
	- In python they have a for-in loop not a for-loop
	- Syntax for for-in loops: for iterator_var in sequence:
	- Went through how for-in loops work

Exercise 33: While-Loops
	- Syntax for while-loops: while expression: 

Exercise 35: Branches and Functions
	- Practice

Exercise 38: Doing Things to Lists
	- Went through how python reads making changes to lists. 
	- You can use function to make changes to list like pop and join.

Exercise 39: Dictionaries, Oh Lovely Dictionaries
	- Syntax for dictionaries: dictionary = {}
	- Went through how to use then and what they can be used for
	- Dictionary limitation: Not keeping the order items are entered.
	- Solution: OrderedDict() 

Exercise 40: Modules, Classes, and Objects
	- Modules are like dictionaries
	- Classes are like modules
	- Objects are like mini-imports
	- Learned the syntax for modules, classes, and objects.

Exercise 41: Learning to Speak Object Oriented
	- Learned about object oriented design.

Exercise 42: Is-A, Has-A, Objects, and Classes
	- Learned the syntax for Is-A and Has-A.

Exercise 43: Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
	- Process of designing and making a program
	
Exercise 44: Inheritance vs. Composition
	- Went through inheritance and compostition, how to use them, the different types, and the advantages and disadvantages. 

Exercise 46: A Project Skeleton
	- Went through how to set up a good project "skeleton" directory
