# LearnPython2 

Exercise 1: A Good First Program
I learned there is no comile fuction in python. Inorder to run the program
you type python2 filename.py in the command line. Also, that you use # 
instead of // to make a comment. 

Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
The lesson was on tips to find errors better such as reading the code 
backwards or reading it out loud. 

Exercise 3: Numbers and Math
I learned that comparison in python are more simple. Also, you don't have 
to have a ; at the end of each line. Lastly, for print line you don't have 
to have (). 

Exercise 4: Variables and Names
When declaring variables you don't have to state its type ahead of time. 

Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing
When setting a variable to a string you have to enclose it in 'string'. 
When printing a variable thats a string you leave %s when you want the 
string and %d for an int. After the ending " you put % and then the 
variable name. If you have multiple you can put them in () seperated by 
commas. 

Exercise 6: Strings and Text
Went through more ways of treating strings.

Exercise 7: More Printing
This program had nothing new in it. 

Exercise 8: Printing, Printing
This program had nothing new in it. 

Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing

Exercise 10: What Was That?
Goes through escape seguences.

Exercise 11: Asking Questions

Exercise 12: Prompting People
Went through a different way of getting input values.

Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables
Went through how to import input values.

Went through two way you can read a file.

Exercise 16: Reading and Writing Files
The program reads the file and then writes information into the file.

Exercise 17: More Files
Went through more ways of dealing with files

Exercise 18: Names, Variables, Code, Functions
Went through the syntax for making functions.

Exercise 19: Functions and Variables
Went through different ways of giving arguments to functions. 

Exercise 20: Functions and Files
Taugh how to print out a file line by line.

Exercise 21: Functions Can Return Something
Went through how to get a function to return a value.

Exercise 24: More Practice 
This program had nothing new in it.

Exercise 25: Even More Practice
In the command line, import ex25, define a variable and called on functions in ex25. 

Exercise 26: Congratulations, Take a Test!
I fixed the error and made the program run.

Exercise 27: Memorizing Logic
Studied truth terms and tables. 

Exercise 28: Boolean Practice
Practice boolean tests to see if I got the correct answer.

Exercise 29: What If
Learned the syntax for if statements. 

Exercise 30: Else and If
Learned the syntax for if-elif-else statements.

Exercise 31: Making Decisions
Expanded the program

Exercise 32: Loops and Lists
Learned the syntax for for-loops, how they work in python and there limitations.

Exercise 33: While-Loops
Learned the syntax for while-loops. 

Exercise 35: Branches and Functions
This program had nothing new in it.

Exercise 38: Doing Things to Lists
Went through how python reads making changes to lists. Went into more 
function you can use to make changes to list.

Exercise 39: Dictionaries, Oh Lovely Dictionaries
Learned the syntax for dictionaries, how to use them, what they can be used for, and there limitation of not keeping the order items are entered. You can use collections.OrderedDict to fix this limition. 

Exercise 40: Modules, Classes, and Objects
Learned the syntax for modules, classes, and objects.

Exercise 41: Learning to Speak Object Oriented
Learned about object oriented.

Exercise 42: Is-A, Has-A, Objects, and Classes
Learned the syntax for Is-A and Has-A.

Exercise 43: Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
