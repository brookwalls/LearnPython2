# LearnPython2 

Example 1:
I learned there is no comile fuction in python. Inorder to run the program
you type python2 filename.py in the command line. Also, that you use # 
instead of // to make a comment. 

Example 2:
The lesson was on tips to find errors better such as reading the
code backwards or reading it out loud. 

Example 3:
I learned that comparison in python are more simple. Also, you don't have to 
have a ; at the end of each line. Lastly, for print line you don't have to 
have (). 

Example 4:
When declaring variables you don't have to state its type ahead of time. 

Example 5:
When setting a variable to a string you have to enclose it in 'string'. When 
printing a variable thats a string you leave %s when you want the string and 
%d for an int. After the ending " you put % and then the variable name. If you have multiple you can put them in () seperated by commas.
